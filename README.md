# Portfolio Site

link: https://zapsters.github.io/portfolio/

This simply is hosting my portfolio site in a place where the code can be seen! I am currently looking for hosting for this site, but as a college student this is satisfactory.

This portfolio was made originally for an open-ended homework assignment (requirements where 4 pages with unique content) and I decided to make a portfolio site!

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me through any of the methods listed on my portfolio site!

Thanks for checking out my work!
