      <h1>Input Stack</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>InputStack</strong> is a frantic, real-time multiplayer game where players must work
        together to manage an ever-growing stack of tasks. These tasks, or “modules,” range from
        simple math problems to word unscrambles, color pickers, and more. Each module requires
        different types of input, such as buttons, sliders, and text fields.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspired by <em>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</em>, InputStack is fully browser-based and
        instantly playable—no downloads or installations required.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        The game is powered by Google Firebase’s real-time database, ensuring seamless multiplayer
        gameplay. Any changes made by one player are instantly reflected for everyone in the game.
        This real-time synchronization keeps the game dynamic, fostering both collaboration and
        chaos.
