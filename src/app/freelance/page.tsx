      <h1>Freelance</h1>
      <p>I build modern, fast, and reliable web experiences for businesses, creators, and organizations. Whether you need a full website, a custom feature, or technical guidance, I help turn ideas into functional, scalable products.</p>

      <h2><strong>About My Work</strong></h2>
      <p>I approach every project with a focus on clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability. My goal isn’t just to deliver something that works today, but to build solutions that continue to function reliably as your needs evolve. I pay attention to structure, scalability, and user experience from the start so that your website or application can grow without needing to be rebuilt later.</p>

      <p>I work with individuals, startups, and organizations who want thoughtful development rather than quick, disposable builds. Whether you already have a clear plan or are still shaping your idea, I can help translate your goals into a technical solution that makes sense.</p>

      <h2><strong>Development Philosophy</strong></h2>
      <p>Good software should feel simple to use and easy to maintain, even if what’s happening behind the scenes is complex. I prioritize clean architecture, readable code, and efficient systems so that your project remains understandable and adaptable long after launch. This also makes future updates, feature additions, or team handoffs much smoother.</p>

      <p>I also believe communication is part of development. You’ll always know what stage your project is in, what decisions are being made, and why they matter. Clear expectations lead to better results for both sides.</p>

      <h2><strong>Flexible Project Approach</strong></h2>
      <p>Not every project starts with a fully defined scope, and that’s completely normal. Some clients come in with detailed specifications, while others have an idea and need help shaping it into something tangible. I’m comfortable working in both situations and can adapt the process to match your level of clarity and technical familiarity.</p>

      <p>For clearly defined builds, we can map out deliverables and timelines from the start. For exploratory or evolving projects, we can begin with discovery, research, or consulting and refine the direction as we go. The goal is always to match the development approach to what actually serves your project best.</p>
