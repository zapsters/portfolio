          <p>
            Hello! My name is Erin Ballinger, and I found a passion for web
            development in early high school. I found my interest in the
            interactive and entertainment side of the web. When my friends and I
            played a lot of the Jackbox Games series, party games that use one
            computer for the game with the players interacting through the
            jackbox website, I always had in the back of my mind "How did they
            do that?" and "How can I do that?"
          </p>

          <p>
            My interest in these party games led me to my path of web design,
            both front and back end. In high school and recently in college
            through my Input Stack project, I have made multiplayer projects
            utalizing Google's realtime database. Through my course work, I have
            been constantly evolving as a web dev, making more professional and
            corporate sites, along with my own projects I have designed,
            developed, and shipped. Links to these projects and more in-depth
            explanation can be found on the experience page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I am a freshman (class of 2027) attending Indiana
            University Indianapolis. I am pursuing double B.S. in Informatics
            and a B.S. in Media Arts and Science with a specialization in Web
            Development at IUI's Luddy Indianapolis school. My future career
            goal is to be a Full Stack Developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my free time, I develop my personal sites (most of which are
            hosted on my GitHub), play music (right now im learning ukelele),
            along with developing games, 3d modeling, and coding C# scripts for
            solo unity projects.
